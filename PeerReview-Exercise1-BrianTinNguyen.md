Description
To assess the solution, you will be choosing ONE choice from unsatisfactory, satisfactory, good, great, or perfect. Place an x character inside of the square braces next to the appropriate label.

The following are the criteria by which you should assess your peer's solution of the exercise's stages.

Perfect
Cannot find any flaws concerning the prompt. Perfectly satisfied all stage objectives.

Great
Minor flaws in one or two objectives. 

Good
A major flaw and some minor flaws.

Satisfactory
A couple of major flaws. Heading towards a solution, however, did not fully realize the solution.

Unsatisfactory
Partial work, but not really converging to a solution. Pervasive major flaws. Objective largely unmet.

==================================================================================================================

Stage 1
 [X]Perfect
 []Great
 []Good
 []Satisfactory
 []Unsatisfactory

The camera controller is always centered onto the vessel and there are no additional fields to be serialied and usable in the inspector. The controller is 5 by 5 unit cross center of the screen.
Great work!


Stage 2
 [X]Perfect
 []Great
 []Good
 []Satisfactory
 []Unsatisfactory

Excellent work on the frame-bound autoscroller camera controller, the implementation of the box movement and the player push mechanism when touching the left edge is smooth and intuitive. The exported fields are well-structured, and the option to draw the frame border when draw_camera_logic is true adds great visual feedback.

Stage 3
 [X]Perfect
 []Great
 []Good
 []Satisfactory
 []Unsatisfactory

Impressive job on creating this position-lock-style camera controller with a nuanced follow behavior, the implementation of a slow approach to the player using a configurable follow_speed and catchup_speed adds a dynamic and polished game feel. It feels extremely smooth. The leash_distance constraint ensures the camera stays responsive without feeling too rigid or detached again, smooth. Great work!


Stage 4
 [X]Perfect
 []Great
 []Good
 []Satisfactory
 []Unsatisfactory

Great job meeting the requirements for this stage! The implementation effectively handles the position-lock lerp-smoothing behavior and responds well to player input, leading the camera as expected. The exported fields are utilized properly, ensuring smooth and intuitive camera movement. Smooth and easy to use. Great job!

Stage 5
 [X]Perfect
 []Great
 []Good
 []Satisfactory
 []Unsatisfactory

The implementation aligns well with the specifications, including seamless speed adjustments, push ratios, and movement logic. The clear handling of edge cases, like corners and different zones, showcases your attention to detail. Drawing the push zone when draw_camera_logic is true is a nice touch for visual debugging. Overall, this is well-executed and thorough. Keep up the great work!



Code Style Review & Best Practices Review

I think you did a fantastic job with this exercise, your consistent indentation and naming conventions make the code readable, the logic for positioning and drawing is clear and concise and the super() calls ensure that the base class's functionality is maintained, which is very good practice.

Looking at the draw_logic, The draw_logic function could be optimized to avoid creating and freeing MeshInstance3D objects every frame; consider pooling or reusing the instance to improve performance. Also, for better efficiency, consider setting up material properties outside the _process() call to avoid reinitializing them.

Overall, I think the code follows best practices very well, but there are opportunities for performance improvements and clarifying some choices. Amazing job and smooth sailing! Keep up the great work!
